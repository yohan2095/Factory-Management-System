# Factory-Management-System

![Full Stack 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76798407/125389635-3484dc80-e3aa-11eb-9369-a5980d807924.png)


This is my first Full Stack Project. On this project I need to create 4 main pages which are: "Login", "Departments", "Employees" and "Shifts".
We can manage data from the data base directly trough these pages using CRUD operations.
This website is managed by users so we need to create a Login page in order for them to connect with a password.
Each user has a limited number of actions per day and afterwards they are not allowed to connect for the next 24 hours.
Once a user is logged-in, His name and number of actions available are shown on every page of the website.
In addition to the CRUD operations on the employee page, we need to create a Search Box. This Search Box should be able to find an employee according
his first name, last name or department.

The website is linked to an .NET server which is connected to my SQL Server Data Base.

The languages i used for this project are:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- C#
- CSS (future versions)

Here's some screenshots from the project (July 13th 2021):
