# Factory-Management-System

This is my first Full Stack Project. On this project I need to create 3 main pages which are: "Departments", "Employees" and "Shifts".
We can manage data from the data base directly trough these pages using CRUD operations.
This website is managed by users so we need to create a Login page in order for them to connect with a password.
Each user has a limited number of actions per day and afterwards they are not allowed to connect for the next 24 hours.

The website is linked to an .NET server which is connected to my SQL Server Data Base.

The languages is used for this project are:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- C#
- CSS (future versions)
